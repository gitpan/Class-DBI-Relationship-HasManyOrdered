Class-DBI-Relationship-HasManyOrdered
=====================================

Class::DBI::Relationship::HasManyOrdered Provides an ordered 'Has Many' relationship between Class::DBI classes.
This relationship enhances the HasMany relationship already provided in Class::DBI to allow you to quickly and
easily deal with ordered 'One to Many' or 'Many to Many' relationships without additional handcoding  while
preserving as much of the original behaviour and syntax as possible.

For more information See Class::DBI and Class::DBI::Relationship.
